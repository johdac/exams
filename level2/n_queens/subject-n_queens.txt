n queens

Expected files : *.c *.h
Allowed  functions: atoi, print, write

Write a program that will print all the solutions to the n_queens problem for a
n given as an argument. We will not test with negative values. The order of the
solutions is not important.

You will display the solutions under following format
<p1> <p2> <p3>...\n
Where Pn is the line index of the queen in each column starting from 0

Examples:
./n_queens 2 ->do nothing

./n_queen 4 -> 1 3 0 2
               2 0 3 1
